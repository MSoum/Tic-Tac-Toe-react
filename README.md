# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. It serves as a foundational example to demonstrate how to set up and run a React application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn (v1.22 or higher)

### Installation

   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
    npm install
   ```

Running the Application
To start the application, use the following command:

```
 npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Building the Application
To build the application for production, use the following command:

```
 npm run build
```

This will create a build folder with the production build of the application.
