# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. It serves as a foundational example to demonstrate how to set up and run a React application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn (v1.22 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tic-tac-toe
   Install the dependencies:
   sh
   Copy code
   npm install
   or if you prefer yarn:
   sh
   Copy code
   yarn install
   Running the Application
   To start the application, use the following command:
   ```

sh
Copy code
npm start
or if using yarn:

sh
Copy code
yarn start
This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Building the Application
To build the application for production, use the following command:

sh
Copy code
npm run build
or if using yarn:

sh
Copy code
yarn build
This will create a build folder with the production build of the application.

Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:

sh
Copy code
npm test
or if using yarn:

sh
Copy code
yarn test
Ejecting
If you need to customize the configuration of your application, you can eject it by running:

sh
Copy code
npm run eject
or if using yarn:

sh
Copy code
yarn eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
